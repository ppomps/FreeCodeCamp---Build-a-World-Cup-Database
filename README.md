These are the results of my time learning at https://www.freecodecamp.org/.
I will update this repository with code from the projects required for the completion of any of the courses I take at freecodecamp.

From the project "Build a Celestial Bodies Database": universe.sql

From the project "Build a World Cup Database": worldcup.sql, insert_data.sh, queries.sh
